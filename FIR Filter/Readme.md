Hardware of a 12th-order Low Pass FIR filter for ECG signal processing.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights of the Project:

Filter Design: Coefficients were generated using MATLAB's Filter Designer Tool, optimized for ECG signal characteristics.

Validation: Tested functionality in MATLAB, including signal waveform plots and FFT analysis, which are attached.

Hardware Implementation: This time instead of relying on MATLAB for HDL generation I wrote the entire hardware in Verilog, focusing on high efficiency and maximum resource utilization.

Verification: Created and simulated a comprehensive testbench to validate the most of the ECG data.
